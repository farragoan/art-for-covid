1\) Share a picture of yourself/friends/family and I will make a digital portrait for you.

2\) In return, all I ask is that you donate at least INR 250/$3.5 to an Indian COVID relief charitable organization of your choice, such as Hemkunt Foundation, GiveIndia, Swasth Alliance, Goonj, etc and show me the receipt with the date. (donations links in Bio)
